Optimization Sampling Methods

Optimization and sampling are two of the most important mathematical topics at the interface of data science and computation. 
The two questions are, in fact, connected mathematically through a powerful framework articulated around the geometry of probability distributions. 
The geometric toolbox that underlies optimization and sampling was initiated in the study of partial differential equations (PDEs) and has evolved into different mathematical disciplines: 
probability, calculus of variations, analysis and geometry. 
While connections are slowly beginning to percolate across disciplines, this program is aimed to be a catalyst for new and interdisciplinary ideas using a principled and unified approach to optimization and sampling.
